## Gemini Transcription Output Format

When using the Gemini service (`--service gemini`), each transcription file includes both a summary and the full transcription text in a structured format. Gemini uses a single-prompt approach that generates both the transcription and summary in one API call.

### üìã SUMMARY:
```
[AI-generated concise summary of the conversation]
```

### üéôÔ∏è FULL TRANSCRIPTION:
```
[Complete transcription text with proper formatting]
```

### Example Gemini Output:
```
üìã SUMMARY:
The customer called to inquire about their recent order status. The representative confirmed that the order has been shipped and provided the tracking number. The customer expressed satisfaction with the service and mentioned they would recommend the company to others.


üéôÔ∏è FULL TRANSCRIPTION:
Hello, thank you for calling our customer service line. How can I help you today?

Hi, I wanted to check on my order that I placed last week. The order number is 12345.

Let me look that up for you. Yes, I can see that your order has been processed and shipped. The tracking number is 1Z999AA1234567890. You should receive it within the next 2-3 business days.

Great! That's exactly what I was hoping to hear. Your service has been excellent throughout this process.

We're glad to hear that! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

No, that's all. Thank you very much for your assistance.

You're welcome! Have a great day!
```

### Other Services
When using Whisper, Google, or Speechmatics services, only the transcription is generated without summaries.

## CSV Output

The application generates a `summary.csv` file in each processed directory. It includes file metadata and, when available, key fields from the per-file analysis JSON (`*_analysis.json`).

- **Filename**: Original audio file name
- **Duration**: Audio duration in HH:MM:SS format
- **Has Transcription**: Yes/No if a `.txt` exists
- **Has Analysis**: Yes/No if an `_analysis.json` exists
- **Timestamp**: Parsed from TP1 token in filename (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
- **Phone Number**: Parsed from TP3 token in filename
- **Call Type**: Parsed from TP4 token in filename (e.g., "outgoing", "incoming")
- **Sentiment, Confidence, Payment Intent, Next Best Action, To-Do**: From analysis JSON
- **Call Tags Count, Concerns Count**: Counts from analysis arrays
- **Advanced Insights**: Emotional State, Conversion Probability, Urgency Level, Rapport Score, Missed Opportunity

Example CSV output (columns abbreviated for brevity):
```csv
Filename,Duration,Has Transcription,Has Analysis,Timestamp,Phone Number,Call Type,Sentiment,Confidence,Payment Intent,Next Best Action
"recording-TP11755659148284TP2TP37561074523TP4outgoing.amr","00:00:20","Yes","Yes","2025-08-20 03:05:48","7561074523","outgoing","neutral","0.80","not_discussed","Share 2 high-fit profiles..."
```

## Analysis Output

The application can analyze audio files directly and generate structured JSON analysis files. Each audio file gets a corresponding analysis file (`_analysis.json`).

### Analysis Services

#### Gemini Analysis
Uses Google's Gemini AI to provide comprehensive analysis including:
- Sentiment analysis
- Key conversation points extraction
- Call classification and tagging
- Next best action recommendations
- Structured JSON output following a predefined schema

### Analysis Output Format
